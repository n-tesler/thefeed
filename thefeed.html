<p>
    This is an image from a Nightwing comic I was reading on an app called Hoopla. I am a huge comic book and Hoopla has free digitizations of almost every book in the SF public library system, so I am frequently reading something on there during transit or my downtime.

        Alarm

    <p>
        Sometimes my alarm clock is the only thing stopping me from sleeping half the day, so I’m trying to be less reliant on it. However, at the same time, I’m also trying to give it other practical uses, such as tracking my breaks during work time.

        Lockscreen

    <img src="img/lockscreen.jpg" alt="first person picture of the golden gate bridge at night">
    <p>
        This has been my lockscreen for as long as I can remember, and I like that I’ve gotten used to it so it's not a distraction everytime I open my phone. But it's also a cool live photo I took on the bridge, so it's still pleasant to look at.

    <p>
        Photography used to be a big hobby of mine, especially during COVID. So every now and then I’ll just snap a picture of something I think looks interesting then play around with the filters a bit for fun.

    <p>
        This is a screenshot I took of the concert info for a band I like and was considering seeing live. I am a huge concert fan and am always looking for new tour dates or events from my favorite artists.

        Spotify
    </h1>
    <img src="img/Spotify.jpg" alt="Spotify's homescreen">
    <p>
        I absolutely love Spotify. It is honestly one of my most used apps simply because I am pretty much always listening to something. Music is a big part of my life and I am always looking for new artists as well as trying to keep up with the ones I already love, so the interface is really good for that.
